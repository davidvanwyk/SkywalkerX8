Longitudinal:

Pitch angle (theta) -> Controlled by: Elevator angle (de)
Propeller speed -> Controlled by: Throttle (dt)

To control...

Altitude^ (alt)
Airspeed* (Va) 

^ Not controlled directly during take-off, climb and descend zones of flight regime. Only becomes a control parameter in altitude hold zone
* Controlled differently depending on which portion of the flight regime we are in

Lateral:

Roll angle (phi) -> Controlled by: Aileron angle (da)

To control...

Course angle (chi)
